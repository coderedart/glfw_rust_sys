     *  does not destroy it for you.  Call `vkDestroySurfaceKHR` to destroy the
     *  surface.

     *  @remark @macos This function creates and sets a `CAMetalLayer` instance for
     *  the window content view, which is required for MoltenVK to function.
     *
     *  @remark @x11 By default GLFW prefers the `VK_KHR_xcb_surface` extension,
     *  with the `VK_KHR_xlib_surface` extension as a fallback.  You can make
